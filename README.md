# Shamir-Secret-Sharing
Basic implementation of Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme in python
Implements the Shamir (t,n) threshold scheme for distributed datum generation. Numeric data values (secrets) are divided into n shares whereby, atleast t shares are required to reconstruct the original secret. 

Polynomial interpolation is done using Lagranges Interpolation
Functions for both share generation and reconstruction are provided.
